# Skill Changelog - Update to FSD v2.1

## Version 2.1.0 - Updated based on Feature-Sliced Design v2.1

### 🎯 Major Changes

#### "Pages First" Approach

- **NEW**: Core principle added - keep code in pages/widgets until you need to reuse it
- Updated all examples and patterns to reflect this approach
- Added detailed explanation of when to extract code to lower layers

#### Updated Layer Descriptions

**Pages Layer**:

- ✅ Can now contain forms, validation logic, API calls, state management
- ✅ No longer just a "thin composition layer"
- ✅ Pages can have their own `model/`, `api/`, `lib/` segments

**Widgets Layer**:

- ✅ Can now contain their own stores, business logic, and API interactions
- ✅ Not just compositional blocks anymore
- ✅ Extract to features/entities only when multiple widgets/pages need the code

**Features Layer**:

- ✅ Emphasis on **reusability** - only create when used in multiple places
- ✅ Don't create features prematurely

**Entities Layer**:

- ✅ Emphasis on **reusability** - only create when used in multiple places
- ✅ New `@x/` directory for cross-import APIs

**Shared Layer**:

- ✅ Can now contain application-aware code (route constants, API endpoints, company logos)
- ✅ Still cannot contain business logic
- ✅ Segments can import from each other

### 🆕 New Features

#### Public API for Cross-Imports (@x notation)

- Added comprehensive documentation for the `@x` notation
- Allows explicit connections between entities
- Examples of when and how to use cross-imports
- Makes bidirectional relationships between entities explicit

```typescript
// entities/user/@x/order.ts
export { UserOrderHistory } from "./ui/UserOrderHistory";
```

#### Deprecated Processes Layer

- Added note that Processes layer is deprecated in v2.1
- Migration guidance: move code to Features with help from App layer

### 📚 Updated Documentation

#### Decision Framework

- Completely rewritten for "Pages First" approach
- New decision tree starting with "Where is this code used?"
- Practical examples for common scenarios
- Golden rule: "When in doubt, keep it in pages/widgets"

#### Anti-Patterns

- **NEW**: "Premature extraction" - the key anti-pattern in v2.1
- Updated cross-import examples with @x notation
- More emphasis on waiting for actual reuse

#### Common Patterns

- Updated "Working with API" pattern to show Pages First approach
- Examples of when to keep code in pages vs when to extract

#### Key Reminders

- Updated to reflect v2.1 principles
- Added 12 key points instead of 7
- Emphasis on Pages First and actual reuse

### 🔧 Tools & Ecosystem

#### Steiger Linter

- Added comprehensive documentation about Steiger
- Installation and usage instructions
- List of what it checks
- Note that it's production-ready

### 📖 Migration Guide

#### FSD v2.0 to v2.1 Migration

- Added dedicated section on migration
- Step-by-step migration process
- Before/after examples
- Clarification that migration is non-breaking

### ✨ Examples & Best Practices

#### Updated Examples

- All code examples updated to reflect v2.1 approach
- More practical, real-world scenarios
- Emphasis on starting simple

#### File Structure Examples

- Pages can now have full segment structure (ui, model, api, lib, config)
- Widgets can have stores and business logic
- Shared can have application-aware code

### 📝 Documentation Improvements

#### README Updates

- Added "What's new in v2.1" section
- Updated all examples to reflect Pages First
- Added information about Steiger linter
- Migration guide from v2.0 to v2.1
- Updated key concepts section

### 🎨 Implementation Checklist

- Updated checklist to reflect v2.1 approach
- Added Steiger configuration step
- Reordered steps to prioritize Pages First

### 🔄 Workflow Changes

The recommended workflow is now:

1. **Start in Pages/Widgets** - Keep code where it's used
2. **Wait for actual reuse** - Don't predict, let patterns emerge
3. **Extract when needed** - Move to features/entities only when you see reuse
4. **Use Steiger** - Enforce rules automatically

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a non-breaking update. All existing FSD v2.0 structures remain valid.

## Deprecations

- **Processes layer** - Should be migrated to Features layer

## Migration from Previous Skill Version

If you were using the previous version of this skill (based on FSD v2.0):

1. Start applying "Pages First" thinking to new code
2. Don't rush to migrate existing code - do it gradually
3. Use Steiger to catch any violations
4. Update your team documentation to reflect v2.1 principles

## Why This Update Matters

### Better Code Cohesion

- Related code stays together instead of being scattered across layers
- Easier to understand and modify features
- Simpler to delete unused code

### Simpler Mental Model

- No need to identify entities and features upfront
- Natural decomposition by pages
- Less cognitive overhead

### Faster Development

- No time wasted on premature abstractions
- Refactor only when you have actual requirements
- Less debate about where code should go

### Team Alignment

- Pages are intuitive for all developers
- Less variation in interpretation
- Fewer conflicts about architecture
